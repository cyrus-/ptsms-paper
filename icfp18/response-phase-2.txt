We revised the characterization of Scheme/Racket-style macros on page 27 to 
be more clear about how an escape hatch could be used to implement TLMs as a layer atop the Racket macro system, per the previous author response. The 
wording was also revised to be more clear about the problem.

- The example from the appendix should move to the main paper.

We have moved the example from the appendix (HTML) into the main paper as
requested, in Sec. 2.2.5
